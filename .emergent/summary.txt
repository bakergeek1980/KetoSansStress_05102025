The trajectory details the development of a French-language Keto diet tracking application, initially named KetoScan. The project began with a comprehensive product requirements document outlining a sophisticated AI-powered mobile app using React Native and Expo.

The initial development phase involved setting up the project, installing dependencies, and using a bulk-writing approach to scaffold the application. This led to significant debugging, primarily revolving around incorrect relative import paths for a central  within the Expo Router file-based routing system. After several attempts, including restarting the Metro server and simplifying components, a stable version of KetoScan was achieved.

Following this, the user initiated two major pivots. First, a request to rebrand the app to KetoSansStress and redesign the UI to clone an app named KetoDiet. The AI successfully implemented this visual overhaul. Immediately after, the user provided a new, highly detailed request to transform the home screen into a complex, widget-based interface with 3D elements, carousels, and progress bars for various metrics like nutrition, water intake, and fasting. The AI acknowledged this new requirement right before this summary was requested, marking the beginning of the next major development cycle.

<product_requirements>
The application, now named KetoSansStress, is a mobile keto diet tracker for the French-speaking market. Initially conceived as KetoScan, its core purpose is to simplify nutritional tracking through AI-powered meal analysis via the phone's camera.

The current and most pressing requirement is a complete redesign of the home screen into a modern, widget-based dashboard. This includes:
-   **Nutrition Widget:** Fixed at the top, featuring 3D-effect rings with gradient colors for calories, carbs, proteins, and lipids, each displaying a percentage in the center.
-   **Water Widget:** A 3D slide bar with a wave effect to show consumption progress, displaying consumed and remaining amounts.
-   **Tips Widget:** A carousel for articles like Keto Vegetables Guide, Benefits of Organ Meats, etc.
-   **Meals Widget:** A list for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, with buttons to copy a previous day's meal or add a new one.
-   **Activity & Weight Widgets:** Progress sliders for calories burned and workouts, designed to sync with connected watches or health apps.
-   **Fasting Widget:** A timer with a start button, progress bar showing remaining time, and end time.
-   **Fixed Bottom Bar:** A central, static element with three buttons: Report, Edit Widgets, and Settings.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Framework:** React Native with Expo SDK.
- **Navigation:** File-based routing using Expo Router.
- **Language:** TypeScript.
- **State Management:** React Context API ().
- **UI & Visualization:** Core React Native components, , and  for charts.
- **Backend:** A functional FastAPI backend () for API endpoints, tested and confirmed working.
- **AI Integration:** Placeholder integration using the Emergent Universal LLM Key for future AI features.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo Router structure, with a FastAPI backend. The frontend code is located in .


-   ****: The root layout of the application. It wraps the entire app in the , making user context available globally. It was a key file during debugging of import paths.
-   ****: Defines the five-tab bottom navigation bar for Accueil (Home), Scanner, Mes Repas (My Meals), Progr√®s (Progress), and Profil (Profile).
-   ****: The main dashboard screen. This file has undergone the most changes, from the initial KetoScan layout to the KetoSansStress redesign. It is the primary target for the new widget-based UI implementation.
-   ****: Provides a basic authentication context. Its incorrect import path was the source of major debugging efforts. The current version is a simplified placeholder.
-   ****: A simple FastAPI server with a  endpoint. It was successfully tested and is ready for further development of API routes for user data and meal analysis.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of the user authentication system beyond the current demo user.
- Integration with a database (e.g., MongoDB/Supabase) to persist user data, meals, and progress.
- Development of the actual AI image recognition and nutrient calculation logic for the scanner.
- Creation of the features from the original PRD: recipe library, meal planning, and community engagement.
- Integration with device health services (Apple Health/Google Fit) to fetch weight and activity data for the new widgets.

<current_work>
The project has just concluded a major rebranding and redesign from KetoScan to KetoSansStress, which is now functional with a basic UI. The most recent user request triggered another major pivot. The immediate task is to discard the current home screen design and re-implement it as a highly detailed, widget-based dashboard.

The AI engineer had just acknowledged this new requirement. The work was about to begin on transforming  to build the new UI, which includes complex elements like 3D-effect nutrition rings, a water tracker with a wave animation, a content carousel, and several other data-driven widgets. The current codebase does not contain any of this new widget structure; it reflects the simpler KetoSansStress design. No code has been written for this new requirement yet.

<optional_next_step>
Begin implementing the new widget-based home screen as per the user's latest, detailed request. The first step will be to overhaul the  file to create the new layout structure and widgets.
