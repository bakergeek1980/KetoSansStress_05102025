<analysis>
The trajectory details the development of KetoSansStress, a React Native/Expo diet tracker, initially focused on a complex widget-based UI. A significant pivot involved migrating the backend from FastAPI/MongoDB to Supabase. This migration faced persistent challenges with database schema creation, requiring frequent manual SQL execution by the user due to API limitations and key access. Despite this, Supabase authentication and basic API endpoints were successfully integrated and tested.

The AI engineer also implemented a detailed meal widget with camera integration, AI analysis, OpenFoodFacts integration, and a flexible bottom navigation bar and corresponding modals for reports and settings. Multiple frontend compilation errors, primarily related to module imports and duplicate function declarations, were debugged and resolved. The user repeatedly requested specific UI adjustments, such as restoring individual widgets and simplifying the navigation bar. The current focus is on implementing critical security and validation features based on the user's latest detailed requirements, after successfully integrating custom app branding.

<product_requirements>
KetoSansStress is an advanced mobile keto diet tracker for the French market, featuring a dynamic, scrollable dashboard with specialized widgets.

**Key Features (Implemented/In Progress):**
*   **Nutrition Widget**: 2x2 macro grid with 3D progress rings for Calories, Carbs, Proteins, Lipids. Collapsing header UI. cal unit for calories.
*   **Water Widget**: Progress bar with wave animation, collapsing header.
*   **Fasting Widget**: Timer with modal for selecting fasting types (12h, 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, Custom).
*   **Activity & Weight Widgets**: Settings modals (via gear icon) with toggles for HealthApp/Fitbit sync.
*   **Fixed Bottom Bar**: Initially with Reports, Add (+), and Settings. Later revised to only Reports and Settings.
*   **Meal Widget**: Sections for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack with individual  buttons. Real-time statistics (calories, protein, net carbs, fat). Settings gear icon to open options modal (HealthApp export, meal panel toggle).
*   **Add Meal Modal**: Three input methods (photo, gallery, manual entry), AI analysis (Emergent LLM), automatic keto score calculation, confirmation.
*   **Backend**: Full migration to Supabase for authentication and data management.
*   **Integrations**: OpenFoodFacts API for food search and barcode scanning, SeeFood (planned).
*   **Custom Branding**: User-provided app icon and splash screen.

**Upcoming/Requested Improvements:**
*   Enhanced security and validation for forms (using Yup).
*   Improved API error handling and loading states.
*   Global state management (React Context/Redux) and custom hooks.
*   Performance optimizations (memoization).
*   Full responsive design, advanced search/filters, favorites, comments, pagination.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard Expo Router file-based frontend and a Python FastAPI backend.



-   ****: The core dashboard screen, orchestrating all widgets and managing UI logic like collapsing headers and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored multiple times to integrate new widgets (, then back to ), navigation bar, modals (, , ), and a custom . Involved significant debugging for duplicate function declarations and import issues.
-   ****: Manages the meal addition flow, including camera/gallery input, manual entry, and AI analysis.
    -   **Changes**: New file creation. Required multiple fixes for  import syntax,  naming conflicts, and icon references.
-   ****: Provides fixed bottom navigation.
    -   **Changes**: New file creation. Modified to remove the central Add button and its logic, retaining only Reports and Settings as per the user's latest request.
-   ****: Displays the custom loading screen with the provided user design.
    -   **Changes**: New file creation, using  for local image loading, integrated into .
-   ****: Configures the Expo application.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include user-provided , , and .
-   ****: Stores sensitive configuration details.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with , , , and  as provided by the user.
-   ** / **:  is the new core FastAPI server, imported by .
    -   **Changes**:  was created to integrate Supabase, handle authentication, and include new endpoints for OpenFoodFacts.  was adapted to run .
-   ****: Handles user authentication.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to use Supabase for user management and correctly validate JWT tokens using the provided .
-   ****: Module for interacting with the OpenFoodFacts API.
    -   **Changes**: New file creation, integrated into  with dedicated endpoints.
-   **Supabase SQL Scripts**: Various  and Python setup scripts were created in the backend (e.g., , ) to define and create database tables (, ) and RLS policies, largely for manual execution by the user due to API limitations.

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of Reports page data and logic.
-   Connect HealthApp synchronization toggles to Supabase backend.
-   Complete SeeFood integration.
-   Resolve persistent scrolling issues with widgets.
-   Implement general improvements: security/validation, error handling, loading states, state management, custom hooks, performance optimization.
-   Ensure  table and all user profile columns are correctly and fully created in Supabase (manual user action repeatedly required).
-   Activate and fully test new API endpoints for meals.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in two primary activities:

1.  **Refactoring the Frontend UI**: Based on the user's explicit request, the AI engineer restored the original individual widget structure on the main dashboard (), replacing a combined meal widget () with the older  and ensuring other original widgets were present. Concurrently, the bottom navigation bar () was simplified by removing the central Add button, leaving only Reports and Settings.
2.  **Integrating App Branding**: The user provided custom app icon () and splash screen () images. The AI engineer downloaded these, updated  to reflect the new assets and splash screen background color, and created a  component, integrating it into  to handle the initial loading state.

The application's frontend is currently in a state where it should display the custom splash screen, followed by the main dashboard with the restored individual widget layout and the simplified two-button bottom navigation bar. Backend Supabase authentication and OpenFoodFacts integration are confirmed functional, but the full database schema, particularly the  table and additional user columns, still requires verification and has been a recurring point of user-assisted SQL execution.
