The trajectory chronicles the iterative development and significant pivoting of a French-language Keto diet tracker mobile application, KetoSansStress. The initial phase focused on building a complex, widget-based home screen in a React Native/Expo environment. This involved creating numerous custom components for nutrition, water intake, fasting, and activity, each with detailed UI/UX requirements specified by the user.

A significant portion of the work involved debugging a persistent rendering issue where only the top two widgets would display. This was traced through multiple root causes, including a missing backend API endpoint, an invalid CSS-in-JS property, and potential routing issues, before being resolved.

Development was highly user-driven, with frequent requests for UI changes, such as removing and then redesigning a bottom navigation bar, implementing complex collapsing animations for the Nutrition and Water widgets, and adding deeply nested settings modals for the Activity and Weight widgets.

The most recent and critical pivot is a complete backend migration. After building out the sophisticated frontend, the user requested to replace the existing FastAPI and MongoDB backend with Supabase for authentication and data management. The previous AI engineer had just begun this migration by setting up the initial Supabase configuration in the backend codebase right before this summary was requested.

<product_requirements>
The application, KetoSansStress, is an advanced mobile keto diet tracker for the French market. The primary user interface is a dynamic, scrollable dashboard composed of several specialized widgets.

Key feature requirements implemented or in progress include:
-   **Nutrition Widget:** A 2x2 grid for Calories, Carbs, Proteins, and Lipids, with 3D-style progress rings. It features a collapsing header that shrinks to a minimal, fixed-top view upon scrolling. Unit for calories must be cal.
-   **Water Widget:** A progress bar with a wave animation, also featuring a collapsing header behavior.
-   **Fasting Widget:** A timer that, when initiated, opens a modal to select from various fasting types (12h, 16:8, 18:6, 20:4, Custom). The selected duration dynamically updates the main widget's display.
-   **Activity & Weight Widgets:** These include settings modals accessible via a gear icon. The settings provide toggles for HealthApp/Fitbit synchronization and other user preferences.
-   **Fixed Bottom Bar:** A minimalist, centered navigation bar with three icons: Reports, Add (+), and Settings.
-   **Backend & Authentication:** All application data, including user profiles, authentication, and daily tracking, must be managed through Supabase.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Framework:** React Native with Expo SDK
-   **Language:** TypeScript
-   **Navigation:** File-based routing with Expo Router
-   **UI Libraries:** , , 
-   **State Management:** React Hooks (, ) and props drilling.
-   **Backend:** Migrating from FastAPI/MongoDB to **Supabase** for database and authentication.
-   **Styling:** StyleSheet API (CSS-in-JS).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard Expo Router file-based structure for the frontend and a Python-based backend.



-   ****: The main screen of the application. It is the most critical file, responsible for laying out all the widgets and containing the complex  logic that manages the collapsing states of the Nutrition and Water widgets. It holds the state for many of the interactive components.
-   ****: This directory contains the reusable UI components for the dashboard.
    -   ****: Displays the 2x2 macro grid. It was heavily modified to support two states (), a detailed view, and a compact view. It also contains logic to conditionally display cal for calories and g for other macros.
    -   ****: A complex component that manages the fasting timer. It includes the main display and a full-screen modal with sub-pages for selecting and configuring different fasting types. Logic was added to ensure the selected fasting duration correctly updates the UI.
    -   ** / **: These widgets were modified to include a settings gear icon that opens a modal with various configuration options, including nested modals for permissions (like HealthApp sync).
-   ****: This file was updated to remove MongoDB credentials and add  and  for the new backend infrastructure.
-   ****: A new directory created to house the Supabase integration logic.
    -   ****: Reads Supabase credentials from the  file.
    -   ****: Defines Pydantic models for data structures (e.g., User, Meal).
    -   ****: Initializes and provides the Supabase client instance.
-   ****: The original FastAPI server. It currently contains the old MongoDB-based routes and will need to be refactored to use the new Supabase client.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the Supabase backend migration by refactoring all API endpoints in  to use Supabase for data storage and user authentication instead of MongoDB.
-   Connect the frontend UI toggles (e.g., Synch. with HealthApp) to the new Supabase backend endpoints.
-   Implement the Reports page functionality, accessible from the fixed bottom bar.
-   Implement the Add meal flow, accessible from the + button on the fixed bottom bar.
-   Resolve the persistent scrolling issue where only a portion of the widgets are visible on the initial render.

3.  **Scaffolding Supabase Configuration:** Three new files were created in the backend to structure the Supabase integration:
    -   : To load environment variables.
    -   : To define data models.
    -   : To initialize the Supabase client.

The work has paused immediately after creating these foundational files. The next logical step involves refactoring the existing API routes in  to utilize this new Supabase client for all database and authentication operations, effectively decommissioning the old MongoDB logic. No frontend changes have been made yet to accommodate this new backend.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue the Supabase backend integration by creating the authentication dependencies and starting to refactor the API routes in  to use the new Supabase client for user management and data operations.
